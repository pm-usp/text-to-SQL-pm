Se você tiver informações sobre as declarações que foram realizadas no banco de dados, como logs de alterações ou histórico de alterações, poderíamos ajudá-lo a contar o número de intervenções feitas em cada declaração. Além disso, se você quiser saber quais são as colunas que sofreram mais de três intervenções (ou alterações) em um determinado período de tempo, poderíamos ajudá-lo a criar uma query que contabilize as alterações feitas em cada coluna e ordená-las por número de intervenções.	select idcase from event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(*) > 3	easy	0

Seria necessário adicionar mais informações ao esquema, como uma coluna que indique o funcionário responsável por uma determinada atividade.
