SELECT Para responder à sua pergunta, precisamos analisar as declarações que foram realizadas no banco de dados e contar o número de intervenções (ou alterações) feitas em cada uma delas. No entanto, como o esquema de banco de dados não contém informações sobre as declarações que foram realizadas, não é possível responder à sua pergunta com base nos dados fornecidos. Se você tiver informações sobre as declarações que foram realizadas no banco de dados, como logs de alterações ou histórico de alterações, poderíamos ajudá-lo a contar o número de intervenções feitas em cada declaração. Além disso, se você quiser saber quais são as colunas que sofreram mais de três intervenções (ou alterações) em um determinado período de tempo, poderíamos ajudá-lo a criar uma query que contabilize as alterações feitas em cada coluna e ordená-las por número de intervenções.

O esquema de banco de dados apenas define a estrutura da tabela "event_log", mas não há nenhuma informação sobre as declarações 49464 e 76667.

SELECT Para responder à sua pergunta, precisamos analisar o esquema de banco de dados fornecido e identificar as informações relevantes. No entanto, noto que o esquema não inclui informações sobre funcionários ou processos de declaração. O esquema apenas define uma tabela chamada "event_log" que registra atividades em um sistema, com campos como "activity", "resource", "cost", etc. Portanto, não é possível responder à sua pergunta com base no esquema fornecido, pois não há informações sobre funcionários ou processos de declaração. Se você fornecer mais informações sobre o banco de dados, como tabelas adicionais ou relações entre as tabelas, posso ajudar a responder à sua pergunta.

No entanto, ao analisar o esquema de banco de dados fornecido, não há uma coluna que indique a quantidade de pessoas associadas à execução de atividades no log de eventos. A coluna "idcase" pode ser uma referência a um caso ou um identificador único, mas não há informações sobre as pessoas envolvidas.

SELECT Para responder essa pergunta, precisamos analisar as informações presentes na tabela "event_log". No entanto, não há nenhuma coluna que indique se uma declaração foi aprovada ou não. Portanto, não é possível responder essa pergunta com base nos dados fornecidos. Se você tiver mais informações sobre a tabela "event_log" ou se puder fornecer mais contexto sobre o que é uma "declaração" e como é relacionada às atividades registradas no log, posso ajudar a criar uma consulta para responder essa pergunta.
SELECT Para responder à pergunta, precisamos analisar o esquema de banco de dados e identificar as colunas que podem estar relacionadas à aprovação. A coluna "activity" parece ser a mais provável candidata para conter informações sobre as ações de aprovação. No entanto, não há informações suficientes para determinar exatamente quantas declarações (ou "idcase") as ações de aprovação aparecem. Para obter a resposta, precisaríamos de mais informações sobre o conteúdo da coluna "activity" e como as ações de aprovação são registradas no banco de dados. Se a coluna "activity" contiver strings como "aprovar", "reprovar", "aprovado", "reprovado", etc., podemos supor que as ações de aprovação aparecem em uma declaração única (ou seja, um valor único na coluna "idcase"). No entanto, se a coluna "activity" contiver strings mais complexas, como "aprovar solicitação de empréstimo", "reprovar solicitação de empréstimo", etc., pode ser que as ações de aprovação apareçam em várias declarações diferentes. Sem mais informações, não podemos fornecer uma resposta mais específica.

Seria necessário adicionar mais informações ao esquema, como uma coluna que indique o funcionário responsável por uma determinada atividade.

SELECT A pergunta é um pouco vaga, mas vou tentar ajudar. Em SQL, "retrabalho" (ou "rework" em inglês) se refere ao uso de colunas ou índices que já existem em uma tabela, em vez de criar novos. No entanto, no esquema de banco de dados fornecido, não há declarações que indiquem retrabalho. A declaração CREATE TABLE é a única declaração fornecida, e ela cria uma tabela com sete colunas. Não há nenhuma coluna ou índice que seja reutilizado de outra tabela. Portanto, a resposta é: não há declarações que indiquem retrabalho no esquema de banco de dados fornecido.
SELECT A pergunta é um pouco confusa, pois não há nenhuma declaração de SQL que precise ser executada. No entanto, se você estiver perguntando sobre quais colunas do esquema de banco de dados "event_log" podem ter problemas com retrabalho, aqui estão algumas possibilidades: * A coluna "id" pode ter problemas com retrabalho se não for gerada automaticamente pelo banco de dados, pois isso pode causar duplicatas. * A coluna "idcase" pode ter problemas com retrabalho se não for única para cada caso, pois isso pode causar confusão ao tentar relacionar as atividades com os casos. * A coluna "resource" pode ter problemas com retrabalho se não for verificada se o recurso existe antes de ser adicionado ao log de eventos. Em resumo, essas colunas podem ter problemas com retrabalho se não forem implementadas corretamente.

SELECT A pergunta é um pouco confusa, pois não há declarações que tenham problemas de intervenções iguais e seguidas. No entanto, posso tentar ajudar. A declaração CREATE TABLE "event_log" é uma declaração de criação de tabela, e não há problemas de intervenções iguais e seguidas nessa declaração. A declaração SELECT não é uma declaração que tenha problemas de intervenções iguais e seguidas, pois é uma declaração de seleção de dados e não tem intervenções. Se você está se referindo a problemas de intervenções iguais e seguidas em uma query SQL, é importante notar que esses problemas são comuns em queries que envolvem operações de agrupamento, ordenação e filtragem. Se você pode fornecer mais informações sobre o problema que você está enfrentando, posso tentar ajudar a resolver.
SELECT resource, activity FROM event_log WHERE id = LAG(id) + 1 AND activity = LAG(activity) ORDER BY resource, activity;
SELECT O problema é que o esquema de banco de dados fornecido não contém informações sobre funcionários ou supervisores. O esquema "event_log" parece ser um registro de atividades no sistema, com campos como "activity", "timestamp", "resource", "cost" e "idcase". Portanto, não é possível responder a essa pergunta com base no esquema fornecido. Seria necessário adicionar uma tabela de funcionários e uma tabela de relações entre funcionários e supervisores para responder essa pergunta.
SELECT Para responder à sua pergunta, precisamos analisar o esquema de banco de dados e identificar quais informações estão disponíveis. No entanto, não há informações sobre funcionários ou supervisores no esquema fornecido. O esquema "event_log" parece ser um registro de atividades no sistema, com informações sobre a atividade realizada, o tempo em que foi realizada, o recurso utilizado, o custo da atividade e um identificador de caso. Não há informações sobre funcionários ou supervisores. Portanto, não é possível responder à sua pergunta com base no esquema fornecido. Se você tiver mais informações sobre o banco de dados ou quaisquer outras tabelas relacionadas, posso ajudar a responder à sua pergunta.
SELECT f.nome FROM funcionarios f JOIN event_log el ON f.id =? (identificar como relacionar os funcionários com as atividades de orçamento) WHERE el.activity LIKE '%orçamento%' Lembre-se de que essa é apenas uma suposição e que a consulta real dependeria das informações específicas do seu banco de dados.
SELECT DISTINCT resource AS funcionario FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%orçamento%' OR activity LIKE '%budget%';
